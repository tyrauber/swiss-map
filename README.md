# swiss-map
A simple map of Switzerland (and the planet).

Uses: 
* [Planetiler](https://github.com/onthegomap/planetiler) to generate vector tiles.
* [Shortbread](https://shortbread.geofabrik.de/) as a vector tile schema.
* [PMTiles](https://github.com/protomaps/PMTiles) for hosting and serving tiles on Cloudflare.
* [MapLibre GL JS](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js) for rendering in the web browser.

## name

The name of this map style is "Swiss Map" because it takes some inspiration from Swiss mapping conventions and has the goal to look good for areas in Switzerland, despite the global coverage of the map.
